module Tutorial

/// This file illustrates the use the new generalized iterators in
/// Hacl* libraries, namely ``Lib.Sequence.repeat`` and its Low*
/// counterpart `Lib.Buffer.loop``.
///
/// - ``repeat`` is a fold-like combinator that iterates a function
/// over a natural interval ``[lo..hi-1]`` starting from an initial
/// accumulator value.
///
/// A particularity is that the type of the accumulator depends on the
/// iteration index. This allows, for instance, to use as an
/// accumulator a sequence that grows iteratively, which is a common
/// pattern in Hacl*.
/// 
/// ``repeat`` is currently defined as ``repeat_right`` below, which
/// has a recursive definition that unfolds to an application of ``f``
/// at the head.
///
/// ```
/// val repeat_right:
///     lo:size_nat
///  -> hi:size_nat{lo <= hi}
///  -> a:(i:size_nat{lo <= i /\ i <= hi} -> Type)
///  -> f:(i:size_nat{lo <= i /\ i < hi} -> a i -> a (i + 1))
///  -> acc:a lo
///  -> a hi
/// let rec repeat_right lo hi a f acc =
///  if lo = hi then acc
///  else f (hi - 1) (repeat_right lo (hi - 1) a f acc)
/// ```
///
/// The `a` parameter gives the type of the function to be
/// iterated. This is more general than a `fold` in that it allows the
/// type of the function to depend in the iteration index. The
/// `repeati` combinator is a special case of `repeat_right` where
/// iteration starts from `0` and the type of the iterated function
/// `f` doesn't depend on the iteration index.
/// 
/// - ``loop`` is a wrapper around ``Lib.Loops.for`` that abstracts
/// over the Low* state used by the body. It takes as input a pure
/// function operating over an arbitrary index-dependent state (as in
/// ``repeat``), as well as a Low* implementation of this function.
///
/// The correspondence between the accumulator in the specification
/// and the Low* state is given by the ``refl`` parameter.
///
/// The memory footprint is specified as a ``loc`` (e.g. a set of
/// locations) also depending on the iteration index, so that the
/// footprint of a loop can grow iteratively -- consider for example
/// a loop that modifies an increasingly longer sub-buffer of an input
/// buffer.
///
///
/// ```
/// val loop:
///    h0:mem
/// -> n:size_t
/// -> a_spec:(i:size_nat{i <= v n} -> Type)
/// -> refl:(mem -> i:size_nat{i <= v n} -> GTot (a_spec i))
/// -> footprint:(i:size_nat{i <= v n} -> GTot loc)
/// -> spec:(mem -> GTot (i:size_nat{i < v n} -> a_spec i -> a_spec (i + 1)))
/// -> impl:(i:size_t{v i < v n} -> Stack unit
///    (requires loop_inv h0 n a_spec refl footprint spec (v i))
///    (ensures  fun _ _ -> loop_inv h0 n a_spec refl footprint spec (v i + 1)))
/// -> Stack unit
///   (requires fun h -> h0 == h)
///   (ensures  fun _ _ -> loop_inv h0 n a_spec refl footprint spec (v n))
/// ```
///
/// One quirk of ``loop`` is that it takes the heap upon entering the
/// loop ``h0`` as argument. It is tempting to avoid this by
/// defining
///
/// ```
/// let loop' n a_spec  refl footprint spec impl =
///   let h0 = ST.get() in
///   loop h0 n a_spec refl footprint spec (impl h0)
/// ```
///
/// However, this does not quite work for ``impl`` functions that
/// depend on the initial heap, and typically have e.g. liveness
/// pre-conditions. By essentially inlining this definition when using
/// ``loop``, we avoid having to state these pre-conditions
/// explicitly, which saves a lot of writing.
